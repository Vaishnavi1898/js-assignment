                <ul>
                <li>String: A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Patil".
                            var a = "John";


                </li>

                <li>Number: To store integer or numeric value
                            var a = "10";
                    Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

                    var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
                    var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals
                    
                </li>

                <li>Boolean : Returns true or false value
                    Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
                    var x = true;
                    var x = false;
                    var x = 5;
                    var y = 5;
                    var z = 6;
                    (x == y)       // Returns true
                    (x == z)       // Returns false
                </li>

                <li>Undefined: a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

                                Var x;
                </li>

                <li>Null: Null is "nothing". 
                    
                          It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

                        Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
                    
                        You can empty an object by setting it to null:

                        e.g: var x = null;
                    </li>

                <li>Array:JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

                          Array items are separated by commas.

                          Indexing of array starts with 0, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

                          var x = ["HTML","CSS","Javascript"];
                        </li>

                <li>Object:JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

                           Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

                           var x = {first_name:"John",Last_name:"Patil"};
                </li>

                </ul>
