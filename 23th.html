        <pre>
             JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and we can initialize the value
            of that variable.

            Example: var a =10;

            Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
            
            The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global and declared inside
            function is local variable.
            
            Variable with same name can be declared more than once
            </pre>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Let:</h1><br>
        <p>
        <pre>
            let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var,we can optionally initialize the variable.

            Example: let a =10;
            
            It allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.

            Variable with same name cannot be declared more than once.


            
       </pre>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Const:</h1>
        <p>
            <pre>
                const values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. 
                
                The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

                Example: const a =10;
            </pre>
        </p>
    </div>


    <script>
        var a = 10;
        console.log(a);
        //This will not throw any error
        var a =20;

        let b = 10;
        console.log(b);
        //This below statement throws an error
        let b = 39;

        const c = 10;
        console.log(c);
        c = 25;   //This throws an error

    </script>
